# Custom Widget

This section explains about how to add the user defined widgets in the dashboard in the release version of 4.1.36 or below and 4.2.68 or later

[v4.2.68 or later](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v4.2.68-or-later/)

[v4.1.36 or below](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v4.1.36-or-below/)

> **NOTE:** Custom widget folder placement has been changed in the v4.2.68 build. Also provided an [utility](/embedded-bi/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/custom-widget/v4.2.68-or-later/#migration-of-custom-widgets-from-lower-versions-to-v4268-or-later) to migrate the custom widget created in lower version of v4.2.68 to support in it, as we have made some API changes in it.
